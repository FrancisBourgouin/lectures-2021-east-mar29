# What was hard during weekend

- Too much information (too much reading / watching)

- State is confusing
- React Breakdown
- Stories ?


- Github is the worst


# React!

- Components (a class or a function that returns valid JSX)
- Props (properties given to a component, akin to arguments given to a function)
- State (Controlling data that can change in time, responsibility is to the component)

## A family example

Parents -> Genes, name

You
  props (genes, name)
  state name (initially: parent given name, currently: something else)


- Hooks
